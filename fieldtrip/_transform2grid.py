      TRANSFORM2GRID ensures that the volume contains the definition of the
        cardian axes, i.e. xgrid/ygrid/zgrid. If the voluyme contains a
        homogenous coordinate transformation axis that is unequal to eye(4), it
        will try to construct the cardinal axis from that transformation matrix.
