    """
      POLY2TRI converts the polygons in a mesh to triangles by splitting
        them in half. The input polygons should consist of 4 vertices.
        Curvature is not considered and the resulting split will only be
        optimal for flat polygons.

        Use as
         mesh = poly2tri(mesh)
