      FT_SOURCE2GRID removes the fields from a source structure that are
        not necessary to reuse the dipole grid in another source estimation.

        Use as
          [grid] = ft_source2grid(source);

        The resulting grid can be used in the configuration of another
        run of FT_SOURCEANALYSIS.
