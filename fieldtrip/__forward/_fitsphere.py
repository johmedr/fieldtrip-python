      FITSPHERE fits the centre and radius of a sphere to a set of points
        using Taubin's method.

        Use as
              [center,radius] = fitsphere(pnt)
        where
          pnt     = Nx3 matrix with the Cartesian coordinates of the surface points
        and
          center  = the center of the fitted sphere
          radius  = the radius of the fitted sphere
