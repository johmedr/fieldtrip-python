      FT_PREPROC_RECTIFY rectifies the data, i.e. converts all samples with a
        negative value into the similar magnitude positive value

        Use as
          [dat] = ft_preproc_rectify(dat)
        where
          dat        data matrix (Nchans X Ntime)

        If the data contains NaNs, these are ignored for the computation, but
        retained in the output.
