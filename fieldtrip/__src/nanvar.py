           This file is intended as a drop-in replacement for Matlab's nanvar. It
           originally forms part of the NaN suite:
           http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6837-nan-suite/
           and was modified to be compatible.


    This file was automatically converted from Matlab to Python using
    [MPython](https://github.com/MPython-Package-Factory/mpython), please
    refer to the original matlab file for the most accurate documentation.
