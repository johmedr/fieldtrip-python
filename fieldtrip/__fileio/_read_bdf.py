      READ_BDF Read EEG data from a Biosemi BDF file

          [data, header] = read_bdf(filename)
          [data, header] = read_bdf(filename, 'Param', value, ...)

        Inputs:
          filename - BDF filename (including .bdf extension)

        Outputs:
          data    - EEG data matrix (Nchannels Ã— Ntimepoints)
          header  - Structure containing header information

        Optional parameters:
          'Channels'    - Cell array of channel names to read (default: all)
          'TimeRange'   - [start end] in seconds (default: all)
          'Verbose'     - Display progress info (default: true)

        Example:
          [eeg, hdr] = read_bdf('eeg_data.bdf');
          [eeg, hdr] = read_bdf('eeg_data.bdf', 'Channels', {'Fz', 'Cz', 'Pz'}, 'TimeRange', [10 20]);
