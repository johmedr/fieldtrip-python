      READ_MAT reads a matrix from an ascii or binary MBF format file

         Usage: m         = loadmat('file');
            or  [m,extra] = loadmat('file');

         LOADMAT('file') returns the matrix stored in 'file' and
         the extra information stored at the bottom of that file.
         LOADMAT works for binary as well as asci matrix files.
