      BND2TRI takes a struct array with one triangulated surface mesh per
        tissue and converts it into a single triangulated surface mesh
        represented as one long list of triangles with per triangle a tissue or
        region type.

        Use as
          [pos, tri, tissue] = bnd2tri(bnd)
