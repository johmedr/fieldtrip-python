      WRITE_BDF Write EEG data to a Biosemi BDF file

          write_bdf(filename, data, fs, channel_names)
          write_bdf(filename, data, fs, channel_names, 'Param', value, ...)

        Inputs:
          filename      - Output BDF filename (including .bdf extension)
          data          - EEG data matrix (Nchannels Ã— Ntimepoints)
          fs            - Sampling frequency (Hz)
          channel_names - Cell array of channel names (length Nchannels)

        Optional parameters:
          'SubjectID'   - Subject identification string (default: 'X')
          'RecordingID' - Recording identification string (default: 'X')
          'PhysicalMax' - Physical maximum for each channel (default: 32767)
          'PhysicalMin' - Physical minimum for each channel (default: -32768)
          'DigitalMax'  - Digital maximum for each channel (default: 8388607)
          'DigitalMin'  - Digital minimum for each channel (default: -8388608)
          'ScaleFactor' - Scaling factor for each channel (default: 1)
          'Transducer'  - Transducer type for each channel (default: 'Active electrode')
          'Prefilter'   - Prefiltering for each channel (default: 'HP:0.16Hz LP:500Hz')

        Example:
          data = randn(32, 1000); % 32 channels, 1000 timepoints
          fs = 256; % 256 Hz sampling rate
          ch_names = arrayfun(@(x) sprintf('EEG%02d', x), 1:32, 'UniformOutput', false);
          write_bdf('test.bdf', data, fs, ch_names, 'SubjectID', 'SUBJ01');
