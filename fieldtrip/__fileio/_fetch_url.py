def _fetch_url(*args, **kwargs):
    """
      FETCH_URL checks the filename and downloads the file to a local copy in
        case it is specified as an Universal Resource Locator. It returns the
        name of the temporary file on the local filesystem.

        Use as
          filename = fetch_url(filename)

        In case the filename does not specify an URL, it just returns the original
        filename.
