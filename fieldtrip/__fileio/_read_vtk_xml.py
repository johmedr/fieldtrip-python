      READ_VTK_XML reads a XML-formatted vtk file containing points in 3D and
        connecting elements.

        this function is a trial-and-error based implementation to read xml-style
        vtk files. There is some documentation online, which seems somewhat
        incomplete, or at least not fully understood by me.

        See also READ_VTK, WRITE_VTK
