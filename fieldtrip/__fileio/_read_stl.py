      READ_STL reads a triangulation from an ascii or binary *.stl file, which
        is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by
        3D Systems.

        Use as
          [pnt, tri, nrm] = read_stl(filename)

        The format is described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
