      MESH2EDGE finds the edge lines from a triangulated mesh or the edge
        surfaces from a tetrahedral or hexahedral mesh. An edge is defined as an
        element that does not border any other element. This also implies that a
        closed triangulated surface has no edges.

        Use as
          [edge] = mesh2edge(mesh)
